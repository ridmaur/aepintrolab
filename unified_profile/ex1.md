## Exercise 1 - Visit the BT website

### Story
In this exercise, the goal is to have you walk through the BT customer journey and act like a real customer.

You can access the demo website by going to [http://lab04.bt.com](http://lab04.bt.com)

On this website, we've implemented Adobe Experience Platform. Every activity is considered an Experience Event and is sent like that to Adobe Experience Platform in real-time, and hydrates the Real-Time Customer Profile.

In this journey, you'll start as an anonymous customer who browses the BT website and after a couple of steps, you'll become a known customer which will fuel Adobe Experience Platform's Real-Time Customer Profile.

By opening the Experience Events panel, you should be seeing an entry for each page you've visited. Please note that Adobe Experience Platform captures and stores all data by linking it to an ID, regardless of whether the customer was anonymous or known. You'll notice that all your page views are shown here, also for the pages that were visited while you were still unknown.
