Let’s imagine an anonymous, unknown customer who browses the telco-website. This customer is in the market for a new combined Entertainment, TV/Internet package and is checking out product pages linked to that. The last product viewed is Broadband & TV, a package that combines Internet and TV. Based on this behaviour, the company is able to retarget this customer and shows a targeted video on websites across the public internet to this unknown customer. 

As part of the on-boarding process of new customers, our customer installs the mobile application and logs in to the app. By logging in to the application with the same credentials as used on the website, we’re able to build a cross-device profile of this customer and all behaviour on 1 devices is now available to all devices. This means that we can take action on that data in a cross-device and consistent way.

Now we have the ability to take into account a customer’s offline presence and behaviour and combine it in real-time with the online profile.

This customer has a Broadband & TV package but doesn’t have a Sports package yet. When this customer walks into to the offline Shop, an iBeacon detects the entry of a customer in this offline environment and is able to show a real-time, personalised push notification. The decision on which content to bring into this push notification is taken in Adobe Experience Platform in real-time and pushed to this customer’s device in real-time. As such, every customer will receive a personalised notification based on their own individual customer profile and behaviour.

--- **Customer retention** --- 

After having invested a lot of time, money and resources in acquiring new customers it is even more important to retain them. At some point in the future, this customer might be likely to change their telco provider. It’s crucially important that we are able to understand the behaviour of customers that are churning. 

Having access to all online behaviour in real-time is critical to make informed decisions. While it’s possible to build meaningful manual rules for churn detection, it’s much more future proof to build machine learning models to detect churn. While there are many data science environments in which to build predictive models, not many of those environments are able to easily calculate, recalculate and send churn scores to the solutions that brands use to communicate with customers. 

With Adobe Experience Platform, we are able to detect this customer’s visit to the cancel my contract-page in real-time. Also in real-time, Adobe Experience Platform is able to recalculate this customer’s churn score and make it available to any solution that is used to speak to the customer. So when this customer picks up his phone to call the BT Call Center, the call center employee will see all of the pages that the customer viewed on his screen in real-time, alongside the real-time recalculated churn score.

With this information, the call center employee and the telco as a brand are able to truly impact the likelihood of this customer remaining a happy customer.

## Scope
We will cover using Launch to set up the Experience Platform, map data against a XDM schema, build a unifield profile and make use of the Query Service to query existing data, setting up streaming data of behavioral and profile data from a website. With Data Sience Workspace we will build a recipe for a churn prediction and make use of Jupiterlab for exploring and manipulate data in a data science workbook.
